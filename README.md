## Film Finder Codecademy

Hello! This project is made by Suryanshu(me) and contains the initial code from Codecademy Intermediate JavaScript + code being added by me to make it better.

### How to get it to work:

After you clone this Git Repository, you will have to navigate to "/public/script.js" and then add your own api key at the top. In order to get your own api key, you will have to create an account with 'The Movie Data Base' and then go to settings on the top right corner of your dashboard. Through settings you will find the api section where you can get your own key.
